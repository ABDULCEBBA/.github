# Reporting security issues
We treat disclosure with care and respect as per our [security disclosure policy on our website](https://octopus.com/security/disclosure).

## What do we consider a 'security issue'?
We use sources such as CVSS metrics and the Bugcrowd VRT to qualify the severity of security issues. We will prioritize higher impact issues over lower impact issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you have found a vulnerability, please do not file a public issue. Please follow the [security disclosure policy on our website](https://octopus.com/security/disclosure) and send us your report privately via email to [security@octopus.com](mailto:security@octopus.com) and we'll triage the issue from there. When it is safe to do so, we will create a public issue to notify other consumers of this repository.

## Is there a bounty if I find an issue?
We don't currently offer bounty rewards for finding security issues in this repository.
